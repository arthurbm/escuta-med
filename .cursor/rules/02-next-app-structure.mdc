# Next.js App Structure

This project uses Next.js App Router for routing and layout management.

## Key Directories
- [src/app](mdc:src/app) - Main app directory
- [src/app/api](mdc:src/app/api) - API routes for backend functionality
- [src/app/(dashboard)](mdc:src/app/(dashboard)) - Dashboard area (route group)

## Important Concepts
- Files named `page.tsx` become routes
- Files named `layout.tsx` define shared layouts
- Directories in parentheses like `(dashboard)` are route groups that don't affect URL paths
- API routes are defined in the `api` directory
