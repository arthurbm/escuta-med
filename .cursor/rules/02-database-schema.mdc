# Database Schema

This project uses a relational database model with Prisma ORM. The schema is designed to store medical consultations and their structured data in separate tables connected through one-to-one relationships.

## Main Models

### Consultation

The root model for a medical consultation:

```prisma
model Consultation {
  id                 String  @id @default(cuid())
  userId             String
  specialty          String  // e.g., "general", "cardiology"
  text               String  @db.Text // Raw text input
  rawTranscription   String? @db.Text
  
  // Relations to all possible data sections
  patientIdentification   PatientIdentification?
  mainComplaint           MainComplaint?
  // ... more relations
}
```

## Data Organization

- Each consultation can have relations to multiple data section models
- Each relation is 1-to-1 and optional
- Section data is stored in separate tables with `consultationId` foreign keys
- The section tables match the structure defined in [patient-schema.ts](mdc:src/schemas/patient-schema.ts)

## Key Relationships

- `Consultation` is the central entity with multiple optional 1-to-1 relationships
- `User` has a 1-to-many relationship with `Consultation`
- Each specialty has its own specific data model (e.g., `CardiologySpecifics`)
- Common data sections (e.g., `PatientIdentification`) apply to all specialties

## Authentication Models

- `User` - Core user model
- `Session` - User session data  
- `Account` - OAuth provider accounts
- `Verification` - Email verification tokens
